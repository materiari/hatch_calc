%h1 About
%p In July of 2014, CrossFit Mission Gorge started programming some workouts based on having athletes follow Gayle Hatch's lifting program.
%p This little web page is up to make it easier for athletes to figure out their lifts for a given day in any week of the program.

%p NOTE: if you don't know your one-rep max for front and back squat I'd say that you don't need this calculator, you need a coach.  Follow the link to our gym and have an expert get you started.
%h3 Some geeky info about this site
%p This site was written as a Rails app, which some would say is overkill for a page that could essentially be written as a single PHP sheet.  Just wrapping up a Software as a Service class and this seemed like a good little exercise as well as a convenience for our community.  If you give the page nonsense inputs it will just simply default in the current week at CFMG (or 1 once the program is over) and assume your one rep max is 100 pounds.
